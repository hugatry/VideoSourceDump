# VideoSourceDump
Dumping ground for source codes used in my Youtube videos. Especially for one-off example codes that I would otherwise delete. Mainly to allow viewers to copy the code for their own use. 
Unless you are coming from one of my videos, content of this repo won't make much sense.
## Folders, files, archives
Each folder has files related to one video. If folder includes zip file with same name as the folder, that is archive that includes all the files in that folder. This is to make downloading projects easier, without needing to download the whole repository, or each file one by one.
